## What is? 🙊

An AI tool to assist in long-term care decisions powered by GPT-3 based on online reviews associated with care homes. Considering online reviews of care home users (carers and residents) it extracts summaries and relevant information using LLM. It may be good for:

✅ Carers who need to decide where to locate their loved ones and ideally want to place them in a care home that offers good levels of quality.

✅ Regulators that inspect care homes in terms of certain quality variables (for example the Care Quality Commission). The direct experience of users highlighting good and bad aspects may help them review and improve their model for care home inspections.

✅ Providers that may not be aware of some quality aspects of the services they provide.
